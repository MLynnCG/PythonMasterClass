# Exercise: Statistics and Linear Algebra
Instructions:
1. Create a 1D NumPy array called `nums` with the following elements:
   ```
   [3, 7, 1, 9, 5]
   ```

2. Compute the mean of the `nums` array and store the result in a variable called `mean_value`.

3. Compute the median of the `nums` array and store the result in a variable called `median_value`.

4. Compute the standard deviation of the `nums` array and store the result in a variable called `std_value`.

5. Compute the variance of the `nums` array and store the result in a variable called `variance_value`.

6. Create a 2D NumPy array called `matrix` with the following elements:
   ```
   [[2, 4],
    [6, 8]]
   ```

7. Compute the transpose of the `matrix` and store the result in a new variable called `transposed_matrix`.

8. Compute the matrix multiplication between `matrix` and its transpose, and store the result in a new variable called `mult_result`.

9. Compute the inverse of the `matrix` and store the result in a new variable called `inverse_matrix`.

10. Compute the determinant of the `matrix` and store the result in a new variable called `determinant_value`.
