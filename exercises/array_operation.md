# Exercise: Array Operations

## Instructions:
1. Create two 1D NumPy arrays called `arr1` and `arr2` with the following elements:
   ```
   arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   arr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   ```

2. Perform the following operations on the arrays and print the results:
   - Element-wise addition of `arr1` and `arr2`.
   - Element-wise subtraction of `arr2` from `arr1`.
   - Element-wise multiplication of `arr1` and `arr2`.
   - Element-wise division of `arr1` by `arr2`.
   - Element-wise exponentiation of `arr1` to the power of `arr2`.

3. Create a new 1D NumPy array called `arr3` by adding a scalar value of 5 to each element of `arr1`.

4. Create a new 1D NumPy array called `arr4` by multiplying each element of `arr2` by a scalar value of 3.

5. Perform the following logical operations on the arrays and print the results:
   - Element-wise comparison of `arr1` with a value of 3 (less than operation).
   - Element-wise comparison of `arr2` with a value of 7 (greater than or equal to operation).
   - Element-wise logical NOT operation on `arr1`.
   - Element-wise logical AND operation on `arr1` and `arr2`.
