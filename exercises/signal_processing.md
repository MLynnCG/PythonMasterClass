# Exercise: FFT and Signal Processing
Instructions:
1. Generate a signal using the following parameters:
   - Sampling rate: 1000 samples per second
   - Duration: 1 second
   - Frequency: 50 Hz
   - Amplitude: 1

2. Perform FFT on the generated signal using NumPy's `np.fft.fft()` function. Store the result in a variable called `fft_result`.

3. Generate the corresponding frequency array using NumPy's `np.fft.fftfreq()` function. Use the same length as the signal and the sampling rate.

4. Plot the signal waveform and the frequency spectrum side by side using Matplotlib.

5. Add appropriate labels and titles to the plots.
