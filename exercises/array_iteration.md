# Exercise: Array Iteration

Instructions:
1. Create a 2D NumPy array called `arr` with the following elements:
   ```
   [[1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]]
   ```

2. Iterate over the rows of the `arr` array and print each row.

3. Iterate over the elements of the `arr` array and print each element.

4. Use the `nditer` function to iterate over the elements of the `arr` array and print each element.
