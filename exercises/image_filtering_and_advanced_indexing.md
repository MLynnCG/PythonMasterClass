# Exercise: Image Filtering and Advanced Indexing

Instructions:
1. Load an image of your choice using `plt.imread()`.

2. Display the original image using `plt.imshow()`.

3. Convert the image to grayscale by taking the mean along the channel axis.

4. Apply a median filter to the grayscale image using `ndimage.median_filter()` with a filter size of 5.

5. Display the filtered image using `plt.imshow()`.

6. Apply advanced indexing to extract a region of interest (ROI) from the filtered image. Choose any rectangular region by specifying the appropriate indices.

7. Display the extracted ROI using `plt.imshow()`.
