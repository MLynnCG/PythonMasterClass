# Exercise: Array Indexing and Slicing

## Instructions:
1. Create a 2D NumPy array called `matrix` with the following elements:
   ```
   [[1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12]]
   ```

2. Access and print the element at the second row, third column of the `matrix`.

3. Access and print the second column of the `matrix` using slicing.

4. Modify the element at the third row, fourth column of the `matrix` to be 99.

5. Create a new 2D NumPy array called `submatrix` by slicing the `matrix` to include the first two rows and the first three columns.

6. Print the `matrix`, the extracted element, the extracted column, the modified matrix, and the `submatrix` to verify your results.

You can solve this exercise by adding code to the previous Python code block or by creating a new code block.


This exercise will help you practice indexing and slicing operations in NumPy, including accessing specific elements, extracting columns, modifying elements, and creating submatrices.
