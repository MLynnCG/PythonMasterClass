# Exercise: Sorting and Filtering
Instructions:
1. Create a 1D NumPy array called `arr` with the following elements:
   ```
   [8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 1]
   ```

2. Sort the `arr` array in ascending order and store the result in a new variable called `sorted_arr`.

3. Sort the `arr` array in descending order and store the result in a new variable called `desc_sorted_arr`.

4. Find the unique elements in the `arr` array and store them in a new variable called `unique_elements`.

5. Filter the `arr` array to only include elements greater than 4 and store the result in a new variable called `filtered_arr`.
