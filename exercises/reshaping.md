Exercise: Array Shape and Reshaping

Instructions:
1. Create a 1D NumPy array called `nums` with the following elements:
   ```
   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   ```

2. Print the shape of the `nums` array.

3. Reshape the `nums` array into a 2D array with 5 rows and 2 columns, and store it in a new variable called `reshaped_nums`.

4. Print the shape of the `reshaped_nums` array.

5. Reshape the `reshaped_nums` array into a 1D array and store it in a new variable called `flattened_nums`.

6. Print the shape of the `flattened_nums` array.

7. Transpose the `reshaped_nums` array and store it in a new variable called `transposed_nums`.

8. Print the shape of the `transposed_nums` array.
