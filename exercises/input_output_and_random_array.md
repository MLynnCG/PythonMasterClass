# Exercise: Array File I/O and Random Numbers
Instructions:
1. Create a 1D NumPy array called `nums` with the following elements:
   ```
   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

2. Save the `nums` array to a file called "numbers.txt" using the `np.savetxt()` function, with a comma as the delimiter.

3. Load the array from the "numbers.txt" file into a new variable called `loaded_nums` using the `np.loadtxt()` function.

4. Print the `loaded_nums` array to verify that it matches the original `nums` array.

5. Generate a 2D random array called `random_arr` with a shape of 3 rows and 4 columns using the `np.random.random()` function.

6. Print the `random_arr` to display the generated random numbers.
