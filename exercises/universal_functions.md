# Exercise: Universal Functions

## Instructions:
1. Create a 1D NumPy array called `nums` with the following elements:
   ```
   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

2. Perform the following operations using Universal Functions (ufuncs) and print the results:
   - Compute the square root of each element in `nums`.
   - Compute the exponential of each element in `nums`.
   - Compute the natural logarithm of each element in `nums`.
   - Compute the sine of each element in `nums`.
   - Compute the cosine of each element in `nums`.
   - Add a scalar value of 3 to each element in `nums`.
   - Subtract a scalar value of 2 from each element in `nums`.
   - Multiply each element in `nums` by a scalar value of 4.
   - Divide each element in `nums` by a scalar value of 2.
   - Find the element-wise maximum between `nums` and `[2, 4, 6, 1, 5]`.
   - Find the element-wise minimum between `nums` and `[3, 1, 5, 4, 2]`.
