# Exercise: Broadcasting

Instructions:
1. Create a 1D NumPy array called `arr1` with the following elements:
   ```
   [1, 2, 3]
   ```

2. Perform scalar broadcasting by multiplying `arr1` with a scalar value of 3 and store the result in a new variable called `scalar_broadcast`.

3. Create a 2D NumPy array called `arr2` with the following elements:
   ```
   [[4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]]
   ```

4. Perform array broadcasting by adding `arr1` to `arr2` element-wise and store the result in a new variable called `array_broadcast`.

5. Perform broadcasting with arrays of different dimensions by creating a 1D NumPy array called `arr3` with the following elements:
   ```
   [10, 20]
   ```

   Add `arr1` to `arr3` element-wise and store the result in a new variable called `broadcast_result`.
