Exercise: Array Manipulation

Instructions:
1. Create a 2D NumPy array called `matrix` with the following elements:
   ```
   [[1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]]
   ```

2. Access and print the element at the second row, third column of the `matrix`.

3. Use slicing to extract the second column of the `matrix` and store it in a new 1D NumPy array called `column`.

4. Modify the element at the first row, second column of the `matrix` to be 10.

5. Reshape the `matrix` into a 1D array and store it in a new variable called `flattened_array`.

6. Concatenate the `column` array with the `flattened_array` array horizontally (side by side) and store it in a new variable called `concatenated_array`.

7. Split the `concatenated_array` into three equal-sized sub-arrays and store them in separate variables called `sub_array1`, `sub_array2`, and `sub_array3`.

8. Print the `matrix`, `column`, `flattened_array`, `concatenated_array`, `sub_array1`, `sub_array2`, and `sub_array3` to verify your results.

You can solve this exercise by adding code to the previous Python code block or by creating a new code block.

Make sure to run the code and verify that the output matches the expected results. 
This exercise will help you practice creating, accessing, modifying, reshaping, concatenating, and splitting NumPy arrays.
