# Exercise: Array Concatenation and Splitting

Instructions:
1. Create two 1D NumPy arrays called `arr1` and `arr2` with the following elements:
   ```
   arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
   ```

2. Concatenate `arr1` and `arr2` along the rows (vertical stacking) and store it in a new variable called `vertical_stack`.

3. Concatenate `arr1` and `arr2` along the columns (horizontal stacking) and store it in a new variable called `horizontal_stack`.

4. Create a 1D NumPy array called `split_arr` with the following elements:
   ```
   split_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   ```

5. Split `split_arr` into three equal-sized sub-arrays and store them in separate variables called `sub_array1`, `sub_array2`, and `sub_array3`.
